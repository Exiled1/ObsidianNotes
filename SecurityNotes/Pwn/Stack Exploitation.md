# Exploiting the stack
---
Rather straightforward since you only need to overwrite the stack address as it jumps out.

The most common methods of attacking are pretty simple:
- Use `cyclic` strings (in pwntools) within input to determine the offset of something you want to overwrite and write whatever address you want
  
- If there's something preventing you from taking control of the return address but you can overwrite something else like `ebp` or `esp`, you can take advantage of the fact that the `leave; ret;` instructions will take the address you put into ebp, and then utilize that as the next stack, so you're usually able to make `ebp` point to an area in memory that you control, then make that area point to where you want to jump.
	- Note, make sure not to load the address you want to jump to into `ebp` directly, put it immediately after that, so `ebp+4` in terms of memory.
		- Ex: [ a b c d e ]
			- Point to `a` which holds something useless like "AAAA"
			- After the `leave; ret;` it'll utilize `b` as the function.
